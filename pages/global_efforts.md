**Background**  
In 2016, MBON was formally recognized as a thematic node of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). The three co-leads of global MBON are: Frank Muller-Karger, University of South Florida; Isabel Sousa-Pinto, University of Porto; and Mark Costello, University of Auckland.

**Asia-Pacific MBON**  
GEO BON recently announced establishment of Asia-Pacific MBON to further development of marine biodiversity science in the Asia-Pacific region, as a sub-group of the MBON and Asia-Pacific BON networks of GEO BON. The geographic scope of AP-MBON extends from pole to pole through Asia and the western Pacific, including the Pacific islands and the Indian Ocean. It includes the deepest ocean trenches, and the Coral Triangle, the highest density of marine species on Earth, as well as the highest densities of human populations.
