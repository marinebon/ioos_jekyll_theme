**MBON: A GEO BON Thematic Node**  
In 2016, MBON was formally recognized as a thematic node of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). The three co-leads of global MBON are: Frank Muller-Karger, University of South Florida; Isabel Sousa-Pinto, University of Porto; and Mark Costello, University of Auckland.

**MBON Pole to Pole**  
[MBON Pole to Pole](https://marinebon.github.io/p2p/index.html) is facilitating the integration of biological and environmental data for countries along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the Americas, from the Arctic to Antarctica. Changes in marine biodiversity are being documented in these regions and effective decision-making requires a detailed understanding of these changes. The MBON Pole to Pole is being implemented as a network of cooperating research institutions, marine laboratories, parks, and reserves that seek to address common problems related to sustaining ecosystem services through conservation ecology. MBON Pole to Pole is a voluntary effort and a partnership among independent monitoring and research programs, GOOS, OBIS, and MBON. The work is aligned with the objectives of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commissionâ€™s Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), AmeriGEO, and the GEO Work Programme.

**Asia-Pacific MBON**  
GEO BON recently announced establishment of Asia-Pacific MBON to further development of marine biodiversity science in the Asia-Pacific region, as a sub-group of the MBON and Asia-Pacific BON networks of GEO BON. The geographic scope of AP-MBON extends from pole to pole through Asia and the western Pacific, including the Pacific islands and the Indian Ocean. It includes the deepest ocean trenches, and the Coral Triangle, the highest density of marine species on Earth, as well as the highest densities of human populations.
