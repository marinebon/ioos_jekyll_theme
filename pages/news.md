**MBON Pole to Pole Progress: GEO BON MBON Webinar and Community Discussion**  
_9/10/2019_  
On September 9, Enrique Montes, University of South Florida, presented on the tremendous progress of the MBON Pole to Pole network in the Americas region. The talk, titled “A Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Pole-to-Pole of the Americas in support of conservation and sustainable use of living resources in the sea” was recorded and is available [here](https://usf.app.box.com/s/08569c61yektdv3odcgwuy5x1cmvuy8p). In summary, knowledge on the status and trends in marine biodiversity, and associated drivers of biodiversity change across the Americas is sparse and geographically uneven. International cooperation is needed to fill observational gaps to satisfy policy targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Convention of Biological Diversity. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Pole to Pole of the Americas ([MBON Pole to Pole](pole_to_pole/)) responds to this need by coordinating data collection using standard methods, and facilitating sharing of information and data, capacity building, technology transfer between nations and groups, and voluntary participation of citizens in biodiversity monitoring.
